# Ashoka_Grade_Checker - Read Me

**Ashoka Grade Checker** provides you immidiate updates on your grades after they have been posted on LMS. LMS, by itself, does not notify you of grade updates.

**Ashoka Grade Checker** runs on your machine so you do not have to enter your credentials on an untrusted machine.

## Setup

**Ashoka Grade Checker** is a single file that provides you with the above functionality. 

You need to have *Google Chrome (Version 87)* installed on your system.

You also need to enable *Less Secure Apps* to be able to send e-mails to yourself.

The *Sleep Time* prompt asks you the time, in seconds, between each consecutive grade check. A recommended value is *300*.

## Credits

A mention to *Archit Checker* who developed a similar code before, which inspired me to develop this software.
